This is my first HTML/CSS project. I tried to imitate the Google homepage, and I think I was pretty successful, as far as looks go. I learned a lot and filled a lot of gaps that I did not know I had before this project. Especially, inheritence of certain attributes by certain elements and positioning of elements. I also started slow and noticed myself getting more comfortable at coding by the end. It was an important and fun experience.
